# 0. Installation

[https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html]()

You can download the Elm installer [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) or just install it using `npm`:

```
npm install -g elm
```

Then create a file called `Pong.elm`.

In the same folder, run this command in your terminal:

`elm-reactor`

This will start start a local development server at `http://localhost:8000`. When you make a change to your `.elm` file your can just refresh your browser and Elm will re-compile your file.
